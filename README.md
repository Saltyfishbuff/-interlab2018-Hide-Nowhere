# Hide Nowhere
NYU Shanghai IMA Interation Lab 2018 Fall Final Project produced by Lexy Li & Yanru Zhu

Hide Nowhere is an interactive game with Arduino, Processing and leap motion. 

In the processing, we create the “Shanghai Tower” to stand for the achievement of the technology, and it will produce the ray to detect people, which stands for the ubiquitous surveillance. The player should control the little men to escape all the surveillance with certain gestures which can be detected by the leap motion. Leap motion will control the servo motor in the Arduino. 

In this game, the little man will have three lives. And each time he lost a life, there are some messages will pop up to remind them. The messages we decided will be your information is posting on the dating website. Your photo is used on the Taobao Advertisement, through which we want to warn people they are losing their privacy.
 
There is no way to win the game since as the time goes by, the scale of surveillance will increase to cover all the map, which stands for the ubiquitous surveillance. And it is also the reason why the project is named “Hide Nowhere”. 

Hide Nowhere是一款以监控密布的大数据时代为背景，旨在提醒玩家注意个人隐私的保护的功能性声控游戏。游戏用Arduino和Processing（Java）编写，由外设装置和软件两部分组成。玩家发出抗议，呼救声（音量的大小），控制软件中游戏小人在地图中移动，躲开监控的探查，而游戏进行的阶段则会在装置中实时展示。游戏给予玩家三次机会，但每一次失败会导致玩家部分个人信息泄露，如接到房产推销电话，个人信息被发布在相亲网站上等，同时每一次失败都会使外设装置中的小人移动到更危险的地方。该游戏没有获胜的方法，因为随着时间推进，监控范围会越来越大，最终覆盖整个地图。
